# TRT: Track Reconstruction Transformer

This repo contains the code of transformer architecture for solving particle track reconstruction problem in high energy physics. The main model is based on [Point Cloud Transformer (PCT)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41095-021-0229-5.pdf) modified to be able to predict tracks parameters directly from input data.
